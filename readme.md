This is my 6th Project after completing the "100 days of code" course. I wrote all codes in my projects myself.

This is a simple game using Turtle based on the old Arcane game called "Breakout".
Rules of the game: In each game you have 3 lives. you can move your paddle left and right using arrow keys to bounce the ball and destroy colourful bricks.
The speed of the ball increases a bit every 10 seconds.
After you loose all your lives or when you destroy all the bricks, the game is over. 

Enjoy the game and if you have any suggestions to improve my code, please feel free to do so. 
I'm still learning so all the tips are welcome.
